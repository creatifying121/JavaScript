# Does JS has classes?

## Objects

- objects are basically collection of properties and methods

## why use oop

- there was no such need, but wehn code is written on higher scale and you have a lot of code to work with, then it sometimes becomes hectic to work with functional code, thus oop is a good thing to use

## parts of oop

- object literal => {}
- constructor functions
- prototypes
- classes
- instances (new keyword, this keyword)

## 4 pillars

- abstraction
- polymorphism
- encapsulation
- inheritance
